            <div class="b1"> Panagbenga Festival (transl.â€‰Flower Festival) is a month-long annual flower occasion occurring in Baguio. The term is of Kankanaey origin, meaning "season of blooming".[1] The festival, held in February, was created as a tribute to the city's flowers and as a way to rise up from the devastation of the 1990 Luzon earthquake.[2] The festival includes floats that are covered mostly with flowers not unlike those used in Pasadena's Rose Parade. The festival also includes street dancing, presented by dancers clad in flower-inspired costumes, that is inspired by the Bendian, an Ibaloi dance of celebration that came from the Cordilleras.</div>
